# Railway Track Crack Detection

This project is an IoT-based solution for **railway safety**, designed to detect cracks on railway tracks using an **ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)** and an **ESP8266 microcontroller**. 

## Features
- Crack detection using ultrasonic sensor.
- Real-time alerts via **Telegram bot**.
- Local **buzzer alerts** for nearby workers.
- Low-power operation with rechargeable battery / solar support.
- Scalable for large railway networks.

## Components
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- ESP8266 NodeMCU
- 5V Buzzer
- Power Supply (Battery/Solar)
- Telegram Bot for instant alerts

## Working
1. Ultrasonic sensor monitors railway track surface.
2. ESP8266 detects anomalies and triggers buzzer.
3. Simultaneous Telegram alert sent to authorities.
4. Authorities act immediately to prevent accidents.

## Future Enhancements
- GPS-based location tracking.
- AI-based crack detection for higher accuracy.
